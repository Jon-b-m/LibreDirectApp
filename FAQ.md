## No more minute-by-minute notifications, but glucose alarms continue to sound
Go to Settings, disable the Glucose Badge under "Other Settings", but leave all alarms enabled. With the glucose badge also minutely notifications disappear. Without the notifications, however, it is also unfortunately not possible to display mmol values on the app icon.

## Display glucose values on the Apple Watch
Create a new calendar in the Apple "Calendar" app, e.g. "Glucose Direct".  Activate the calendar export in the Glucose Direct app, also select the created calendar there.

On the Apple Watch, activate a complication with the calendar selection "Your Schedule" on your Watch Face.
